"""The nmap wrapper is used to easily and efficiently perform nmap scans with python-nmap.

It wraps the relevant scan functions of nmap's `PortScanner`. The scan results are stored locally to
make them accessable later if needed. And this class also provides a way to scan asynchronously for
network devices at a specific address or subnet.
