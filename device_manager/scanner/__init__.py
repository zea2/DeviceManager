"""The device scanners are usefull to scan for connected devices of different types.

There are special device scanners (like `USBDeviceScanner` and `LANDeviceScanner`). These are used
to scan a specific protocol for connected devices. They are implemented for windows and linux to
make them work on the most common platforms. The windows and linux specific classes are imported
automatically depending on your system. Additionally, there is the general `DeviceScanner` that uses
the specific device scanners inside. So this class can be used to scan for different device types if
the type is unknown or if the user specifies a specific type, the scan is focused on this type.

Examples:
    s = DeviceScanner()  # Creates the general device scanner
    ls = s.list_devices()  # Lists all connected devices that can be found directly
    d1 = s.find_device(serial="1234567890AB")  # Returns a (usb) device with the requested serial no
    d2 = s.find_device(mac_address="12:34:56:78:90:AB")  # A (lan) device matching the mac address
    l = s["lan"].list_devices()  # Lists all knwon lan devices (maybe not all)
    l = s["lan"].nmap.scan(...)  # Scans for ethernet devices which should find all devices matching
                                 # the request. For more information see `NMAPWrapper`
